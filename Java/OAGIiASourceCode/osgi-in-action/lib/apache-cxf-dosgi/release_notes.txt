Apache CXF Distributed OSGi 1.1 Release Notes
=============================================

Specific issues, features, and improvements fixed in this version
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Distributed OSGi 1.1 release provides the Reference Implementation
of the Remote Services Specification version 1.0. Chapter 13 in the OSGi
Compendium Specification (http://www.osgi.org/Download/Release4V42).

New features in this release include:

* A live Discovery System is now supported. The CXF-DOSGi implementation
  makes use of Apache Zookeeper (http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper) as
  the Discovery Server and provides client-side bundles for transparent
  interaction with Zookeeper. See the Discovery Documentation pages
  (http://cxf.apache.org/dosgi-discovery.html) for more details.

* REST support for JAX-RS-based Remoted Services and Consumers through
  the org.apache.cxf.rs configuration type.

* Many user issues have been addressed. In addition the following bugs
  have been fixed:

[CXF-2182] - Exceptions when remoting pre-existing service
[CXF-2337] - org.apache.cxf.dosgi.dsw.ClassUtils#getInterfaceClass() method
             should search through super class interfaces too
[CXF-2435] - Distributed OSGi having a problem with a custom type method
             argument
[CXF-2288] - Bundle cannot be restarted
[CXF-2385] - Discovery doesn't fully translate 'localhost' into a proper 
             machine name
[CXF-2200] - Consuming more than 1 service using Spring-DM doesn't work


Known limitations :

* Schema validation can not be done for JAX-RS-based endpoints which use
  Aegis databinding
